# ðŸŽ‰ FIXED: Video Player Infinite Loading Loop

## The Problem

Your player URL was being generated multiple times per second, causing the iframe to reload continuously. The console showed:

```
Generated Movie Player URL: https://www.vidking.net/embed/movie/1156594?color=6366f1
Generated Movie Player URL: https://www.vidking.net/embed/movie/1156594?color=6366f1
Generated Movie Player URL: https://www.vidking.net/embed/movie/1156594?color=6366f1
...
```

## The Solution

### Root Cause
The `getPlayerUrl()` function was being called on every render without memoization, creating an infinite render loop.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Memoized Player URL** in `WatchView.tsx`:
   ```jsx
   // OLD (caused infinite loop)
   const playerUrl = getPlayerUrl();
   
   // NEW (fixed)
   const playerUrl = React.useMemo(() => getPlayerUrl(), [playerKey]);
   ```

2. **Removed useEffect dependency on playerUrl**:
   ```jsx
   // OLD
   useEffect(() => {
     // ...
   }, [playerUrl, playerKey]);
   
   // NEW
   useEffect(() => {
     // ...
   }, [playerKey]); // Only re-run when playerKey changes
   ```

3. **Removed console.log statements** that were triggering extra renders

## How It Works Now

1. Player URL is generated **once** when `playerKey` changes
2. URL is memoized and doesn't change unless `playerKey` updates
3. `playerKey` only updates when:
   - User starts watching new content
   - User changes episode/season
   - User clicks retry button

## Test It Now

1. **Start your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Try playing a movie:**
   - Go to any movie
   - Click play
   - Player should load immediately without looping

3. **Check the debug panel:**
   - In development mode, you'll see the debug panel below the player
   - It shows the generated URL
   - You can copy or open it in a new tab

## Features Added

âœ… Loading state indicator (5-second timeout)  
âœ… Error handling with retry button  
âœ… Memoized player URL (prevents infinite loops)  
âœ… Debug panel (dev mode only)  
âœ… Better iframe security attributes  
âœ… Copy URL and Open Direct buttons  

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Clear browser cache and reload**
2. **Check if the URL works in a new tab** (use "Open Direct" button)
3. **Try different content** (some TMDB IDs might not be available)
4. **Disable ad blockers** temporarily
5. **Try incognito mode**

## Summary of All Changes

### Files Modified:
- âœ… `src/views/WatchView.tsx` - Added memoization, error handling, loading states
- âœ… `src/App.tsx` - Removed console.log statements
- âœ… `src/components/PlayerDebugInfo.tsx` - NEW: Debug component
- âœ… `test-player.html` - NEW: Standalone test page
- âœ… `PLAYER_FIX_README.md` - NEW: Debugging guide

### Key Changes:
1. Player URL is now memoized with `React.useMemo()`
2. Only re-generates when `playerKey` changes
3. Removed infinite render loop trigger
4. Added visual feedback (loading/error states)
5. Added debug tools for development

## Why The URL Worked in New Tab

The URL itself was always correct! The problem was:
- The iframe kept reloading because the URL was being regenerated
- Opening in new tab doesn't have this render loop
- This confirmed the issue was in React, not the player

## You're All Set! ðŸš€

The player should now:
- âœ… Load without infinite loops
- âœ… Play videos smoothly
- âœ… Show loading indicators
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully
- âœ… Provide debugging info

Enjoy your streaming app! ðŸŽ¬
