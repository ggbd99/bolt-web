# 🎬 Trailer Feature Added!

## What's New

I've added a clean trailer player to your details/info page! Here's what was implemented:

### ✨ Features

1. **"Watch Trailer" Button** on the details page
   - Only shows if a trailer is available
   - Purple hover effect to distinguish from Play button
   - Positioned between Play and Bookmark buttons

2. **Clean Trailer Player**
   - Uses YouTube's nocookie domain for better privacy
   - Minimal branding with `modestbranding=1`
   - No suggested videos with `rel=0`
   - Auto-plays when opened
   - Fullscreen capable
   - Dark themed controls

3. **User-Friendly Controls**
   - Click outside to close
   - Press ESC to close
   - X button in top-right corner
   - Shows trailer title below video
   - Smooth fade-in animation

### 📁 Files Modified

1. **`src/App.tsx`**
   - Added `videos` property to `MediaItem` type
   - Updated API calls to include `videos` in `append_to_response`

2. **`src/views/DetailsView.tsx`**
   - Added trailer state management
   - Added "Watch Trailer" button
   - Finds official trailers from YouTube
   - Renders TrailerPlayer modal

3. **`src/components/TrailerPlayer.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Clean, minimal trailer player
   - Full-screen overlay
   - ESC key and click-outside support
   - Responsive design

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **API Fetches Videos**
   - When loading details, TMDB returns available videos
   - Includes trailers, teasers, clips, etc.

2. **Finds Best Trailer**
   - Prioritizes official trailers
   - Falls back to any YouTube trailer if official not available
   - Only shows button if trailer exists

3. **Clean Playback**
   - Uses `youtube-nocookie.com` domain
   - Minimal YouTube branding
   - No related video suggestions
   - Auto-plays on open

### 🎨 UI/UX Details

**Watch Trailer Button:**
- Purple theme (different from cyan Play button)
- Film icon
- Same size and style as other buttons
- Smooth hover animation

**Trailer Modal:**
- Full-screen dark overlay (95% opacity)
- Centered video player
- 16:9 aspect ratio
- Rounded corners
- Trailer title below video
- Helper text: "Press ESC or click outside to close"

### 📺 YouTube Embed Parameters

The player uses these parameters for a clean experience:

```
autoplay=1          - Start playing immediately
controls=1          - Show playback controls
modestbranding=1    - Minimal YouTube branding
rel=0               - Don't show related videos
showinfo=0          - Hide video title
iv_load_policy=3    - Hide annotations
color=white         - White progress bar
playsinline=1       - Better mobile experience
```

### ✅ Testing

To test the trailer feature:

1. **Navigate to any movie/TV show details page**
2. **Look for the "Watch Trailer" button**
   - If it's there, the content has a trailer
   - If not, TMDB doesn't have a trailer for that content

3. **Click "Watch Trailer"**
   - Modal should open with trailer auto-playing
   - Click outside, press ESC, or click X to close

4. **Try these movies** (known to have trailers):
   - Avengers: Endgame (299534)
   - Deadpool & Wolverine (533535)
   - Dune: Part Two (693134)
   - The Dark Knight (155)

### 🔒 Privacy & Performance

**Benefits of youtube-nocookie.com:**
- Better privacy (no tracking cookies until user interacts)
- Faster loading
- GDPR-friendly
- Same video quality as regular YouTube

### 🎨 Customization Options

If you want to customize the trailer player:

### 📝 Notes

- Not all content has trailers (TMDB limitation)
- Trailers are only from YouTube (TMDB limitation)
- Official trailers are preferred over unofficial ones
- The player is responsive and works on all screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation supported (ESC key)

Enjoy your new trailer feature! 🎬✨
